## ⚙️ Setup and Installation

### **1. Clone the Project**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saicharanyeluri/test-management-system.git
cd test-management-system
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**

```bash
pip install streamlit mysql-connector-python pandas
```

### **3. MySQL Database Configuration**

Create the primary database and initial required tables in your MySQL environment:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE quiz;
USE quiz;

-- Stores user authentication details (Teachers/Admins and Students)
CREATE TABLE accounts (
  name VARCHAR(100),
  pass INT -- Assuming numeric password for students
);

-- Keeps a record of all Tests available in the system
CREATE TABLE tests_available (
  s_no INT PRIMARY KEY,
  test_name VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Note: Specific test tables (e.g., test_math_scores, test_math_questions) 
-- are automatically generated by the application when a teacher creates a new Test.
```

### **4. Run the Application**

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
